2. What is Virtual DOM in react?
   Virtual Dom is an abstraction of the actual dom . It's lightweight and fast because it
   doesnâ€™t directly interact with the browser, instead it creates a tree data structure that
   represents the UI . When state changes , only those parts of the virtual dom are updated
   which have changed not the whole thing . This makes rendering very efficient as we don't
   have to update the entire page every time there is a change but just the part which has
   changed .
